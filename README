Madeleine is a Ruby implementation of Object Prevalence: Transparent
persistence of business objects using command logging and complete
system snapshots.

Madeleine's design is based on Prevayler, the original Java
prevalence layer.

Installation:

    Typical installation procedure is:
    $ ruby install.rb config
    $ ruby install.rb setup
    # ruby install.rb install  (may require root privilege)
    Try 'ruby install.rb --help' for detailed usage.

    [From the documentation of Minero Aoki's 'install.rb']

Usage:

    require 'madeleine'

    # Create an application as a prevalent system

    madeleine = Madeleine::SnapshotMadeleine.new(SomeExampleApplication.new(),
                                                 "my_example_storage")

    # Do modifications of the system by sending commands through
    # the Madeleine instance. A command is an object with a suitable
    # "execute(system)" method.

    madeleine.execute_command(command)
