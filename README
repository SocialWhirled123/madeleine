Madeleine is a Ruby implementation of Object Prevalence: Transparent
persistence of business objects using command logging and complete
system snapshots.

https://github.com/ghostganz/madeleine

Madeleine's design is based on Prevayler, the original Java
prevalence layer.


Usage:

    require 'madeleine'

    # Create an application as a prevalent system

    madeleine = SnapshotMadeleine.new("my_example_storage") {
      SomeExampleApplication.new()
    }

    # Do modifications of the system by sending commands through
    # the Madeleine instance. A command is an object with a suitable
    # "execute(system)" method.

    madeleine.execute_command(command)


Requirements:

    * Ruby 1.8.7 or later
