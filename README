Madeleine is a Ruby implementation of Object Prevalence: Transparent
persistence of business objects using command logging and complete
system snapshots.

<http://madeleine.sourceforge.net/>

Madeleine's design is based on Prevayler, the original Java
prevalence layer.

Installation:

    Typical installation procedure is:
    $ ruby install.rb config
    $ ruby install.rb setup
    # ruby install.rb install  (may require root privilege)
    Try 'ruby install.rb --help' for detailed usage.

    [From the documentation of Minero Aoki's 'install.rb']

Usage:

    require 'madeleine'

    # Create an application as a prevalent system

    madeleine = SnapshotMadeleine.new("my_example_storage") {
      SomeExampleApplication.new()
    }

    # Do modifications of the system by sending commands through
    # the Madeleine instance. A command is an object with a suitable
    # "execute(system)" method.

    madeleine.execute_command(command)


Requirements:

    * Ruby 1.8

    Additionaly, the sample code also uses ruby/tk and Distributed
    Ruby (DRb).

Known problems:

    * Won't run in some Windows-ports of Ruby due to missing
      fsync() call.
    * Unit tests break in Windows due to different file deletion
      semantics.

Credits:

    Madeleine was written by Anders Bengtsson (prevalence core
    implementation) and Stephen Sykes (automatic commands implementation),
    with the help of Johan Lind (finding bugs, feedback), Håkan Råberg
    (testing) and Jon Tirsén (design feedback).

    Thanks to Klaus Wuestefeld and the Prevayler developers for the
    model of this software; to Minero Aoki for the installer; to Matz and
    the core developers for the Ruby language!
